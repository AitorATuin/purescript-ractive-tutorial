<p>We are cool enough, we can show dynamically a nice greeting to everyone, but it would be nicer if spanish people could understand us when being polite.</p>
<p>That&#39;s what we are going to do now, we are going to change the content of our message.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to change our beautiful but static template with something like this:</p>
<p>{{=&lt;% %&gt;=}}</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;h2 class=&quot;hello&quot;&gt;{{greetings}} {{name}}&lt;/h2&gt;</code></pre>
<p>&lt;%={{ }}=%&gt;</p>
<p>Good! We have created two mustache delimiters which will be binded to the data in our ractive object.</p>
<p>Lets use this template to show our old but remarkable message.</p>
<p>The <strong>PureScript</strong> snippet to do this is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell">import Control.Eff.Ractive

main :: Eff (ractiveM :: RactiveM) Unit
main = ractive &quot;template&quot; &quot;#document&quot; {greeting: &quot;Hej, hej&quot;, name: &quot;VÃ¤rld!&quot;}</code></pre>
<button class="btn btn-primary" on-click="run1">run</button>

<p>Ok, now we have the same behavior than before but being dynamic, we can change the value of <code>greeting</code> and <code>name</code> and ractive will update the view.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see how to do that in <strong>PureScript</strong>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-haskell">changeGreeting :: Ractive -&gt; String -&gt; String -&gt; Eff (ractiveM :: RactiveM) Unit
changeGreeting ractive = do
  set &quot;greeting&quot; &quot;Hola&quot; ractive
  set &quot;name&quot; &quot;Mundo&quot; ractive</code></pre>
<p>That function gets a <strong>Ractive</strong> instance and sets new values <code>greeting</code> and <code>name</code>.</p>
<p>Try to run that function!</p>
<button class="btn btn-primary" on-click="run2">run</button>

<p>Just like we did before with the first example, let&#39;s try to explain that small chunk of <strong>purescript</strong> code.</p>
<ul>
<li>First we load the module with <code>import Control.Eff.Ractive</code></li>
<li>Then, we define function which the only interesting thing that it does is to create a new ractive object.
To create it we pass three arguments to the <em>ractive</em> function, the first one is the template we want to use (our nice greeting here),
the second one is the element where we want to show the message (all the element&#39;s children will be replaced!) and finally an object
with the data we want to bind (more on this later.)</li>
<li>Please note that creating an object is a side-effect, so not allowed in a pure functional language like <strong>purescript</strong>,
that&#39;s the reason why <em>ractive</em> function returns an <em>forall eff. Eff(ractiveM :: RactiveM) Ractive</em>.
See this <a href="http://www.purescript.org/posts/Eff-Monad/" title="Handling Native Effects with the Eff Monad">post</a> for a more detailed explanation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="functions-involved-here-and-types-">Functions involved here (and types)</h3>
<hr>
<p>Let&#39;s see the only function we have used here: <em>ractive</em> and the type of it (we are now functional programmers so we really care about types!)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>ractive</em></strong> :: forall a eff. String -&gt; String -&gt; a -&gt; Eff (ractiveM :: RactiveM | e)</li>
</ul>
